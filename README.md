# Sheba Lagbe – Hospital at Home

Live Demo: https://seba-lagbe.vercel.app 


## Project Overview

**Sheba Lagbe** is a complete **Hospital-at-Home healthcare platform** built from scratch using **Next.js 15 (App Router), React 19, Tailwind CSS & Lucide Icons** — no UI library, 100% custom design.

This is a **real-world healthcare booking system** where patients can:
- Browse & book home nursing, doctor visits, physiotherapy, medical equipment
- View detailed service pages with dynamic routing
- Fill booking forms with date/time selection
- See their dashboard with booking history
- Service providers (nurses/doctors) have their own dashboard to accept/decline jobs

> This project was built to showcase **strong UI/UX sense**, **clean & modern design**, **complex user flows**, and **production-ready Next.js architecture**.

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js 15** (App Router + React Server Components)
- **React 19** (with `use()` for async params)
- **Tailwind CSS** (fully custom design)
- **Lucide React** (beautiful icons)
- **Vercel** (deployment + preview URLs)

---

## Design Philosophy

- Light, clean, trusted healthcare aesthetic
- Blue as primary color → conveys trust & professionalism
- Generous spacing, rounded corners, subtle shadows
- Focus on readability and emotional connection
- Mobile-first approach (most users in Bangladesh use mobile)

## Pages & User Flows
Home → Services → Service Detail → Booking Form → Confirmation Call
Home → Dashboard → View History → Rebook
Provider Login → Provider Dashboard → Accept Job → Start Visit


---

## Why This Project Stands Out

- Not just a landing page — a complete healthcare ecosystem
- Real user journeys for both patients and service providers
- Production-level code quality (no console errors, responsive, fast)
- Dynamic routing with proper error handling (`notFound()`)
- Built with latest Next.js 15 features (async params with `use()`)
- Deployed live on Vercel — anyone can test it
